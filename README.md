> ⚠️ **npm Package Ownership Update**

The `ralph` **npm package** is being transferred to the ownership of **rauchg** (Guillermo Rauch), CEO of Vercel.

This git repository will remain under its current ownership.

## What’s Changing

- Version **2.0.0** is the final npm release managed by **simonmcmanus**.
- This release intentionally contains no functional code and serves as a clear transition point on npm.
- Ownership of the `ralph` package on npm is moving to **rauchg**.
- Future npm releases (beginning with v3.0.0) will be published by the team at Vercel.

## Important: Repository and npm Package Will Diverge

From this point forward, this GitHub repository and the `ralph` npm package will represent **separate projects**.

- This git repository will remain under the ownership of **simonmcmanus** and will not track or mirror the npm package going forward.
- The npm package `ralph` will be developed and maintained independently by **rauchg** and the team at Vercel.

Users should not assume alignment between this repository and future npm releases.

## Repository History

The original implementation of `ralph` will continue to be available in this repository’s commit history.
